			<h2>the alt attribute</h2>
			<p>use the alt attribute so image info can be read by screen readers</p>
			<p>
				use an empty alt attribute for images with explanation text, or images
				without meaning such as decoration and background images

			<h2>headings</h2>
			<p>
				screen readers can be set to read only the headings on a page so the
				user gets a summary
			</p>
			<p>choose header tags based on semantic meaning, not just font size</p>
			<p>
				lower ranked headings imply subsections. don't jump from h2 to h4 - edit
				sizing with css
			</p>
			<p>only use one h1 tag per page</p>
			<h2>semantic tags</h2>
			<p>these include main, header, footer, nav, article and section</p>
			<p>
				assistive technologies can access this information to provide better
				page summary or navigation options to their user
			</p>
			<p>
				only use one main element per page - don't use it for items that repeat
				across pages such as navigation links
			</p>
			<p>
				main also offers assistive devices "jump to main content" functionality
			</p>
			<p>
				use article to wrap independent, self-contained content such as blog
				entries, forum posts and news articles
			</p>
			<p>
				div - groups content | section - groups related content | article -
				groups independent, self-contained content
			</p>
			<p>
				header is used to wrap introductory information or navigation links for
				its parent tag and works well around content that's repeated at the top
				on multiple pages
			</p>
			<p>header also offers assistive devices "jump to header" functionality</p>
			<p>nav wraps around main navigation links, but not footer links</p>
