		<header><h1>applied accessibility</h1></header>
		<main>
			<h2>the alt attribute</h2>
			<p>use the alt attribute so image info can be read by screen readers</p>
			<p>
				use an empty alt attribute for images with explanation text, or images
				without meaning such as decoration and background images
			</p>
			<div>
				<img
					src="theknight.png"
					alt="the knight from hollow knight"
					id="knightimage"
				/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<img
					src="theknigh.png"
					alt="the knight from hollow knight"
					id="knightimage"
				/>
			</div>
			<h2>headings</h2>
			<p>
				screen readers can be set to read only the headings on a page so the
				user gets a summary
			</p>
			<p>choose header tags based on semantic meaning, not just font size</p>
			<p>
				lower ranked headings imply subsections. don't jump from h2 to h4 - edit
				sizing with css
			</p>
			<p>only use one h1 tag per page</p>
			<h2>semantic tags</h2>
			<p>these include main, header, footer, nav, article and section</p>
			<p>
				assistive technologies can access this information to provide better
				page summary or navigation options to their user
			</p>
			<p>
				only use one main element per page - don't use it for items that repeat
				across pages such as navigation links
			</p>
			<p>
				main also offers assistive devices "jump to main content" functionality
			</p>
			<p>
				use article to wrap independent, self-contained content such as blog
				entries, forum posts and news articles
			</p>
			<p>
				div - groups content | section - groups related content | article -
				groups independent, self-contained content
			</p>
			<p>
				header is used to wrap introductory information or navigation links for
				its parent tag and works well around content that's repeated at the top
				on multiple pages
			</p>
			<p>header also offers assistive devices "jump to header" functionality</p>
			<p>nav wraps around main navigation links, but not footer links</p>
			<p>
				footer is primarily used to contain copyright information or links to
				related documents that usually sit at the bottom of a page and also has
				the "jump to" feature
			</p>
			<h2>audio content</h2>
			<p>use audio tags around audio content</p>
			<p>
				audio content also needs alternative text - usually nearby text or link
				to a transcript
			</p>
			<p>supports the controls attribute</p>
			<p>
				<audio controls>
					<source
						src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/screen-reader.mp3"
						type="audio/mpeg"
					/>
					A sound clip of Zersiax's screen reader in action.
				</audio>
			</p>
			<h2>figure and figcaption</h2>
			<p>
				used to wrap visual representations, such as charts, and their captions
			</p>
			<p>adds both semantic info and a text explanation</p>
			<h2>forms</h2>
			<p>
				use the label tag to wrap the text for a specific form control item,
				usually the name or label for a choice
			</p>
			<p>
				the for attribute on a label tag explicitly associates that label with
				the form control and is used by screen readers - must be same value as
				form control id
			</p>
			<form>
				<label for="name">Name:</label>
				<input type="text" id="name" name="name" />
			</form>
			<p>
				use fieldset tag on radio buttons to show that they are grouped together
				- use legend tag for description
			</p>
			<p>
				don't use these if selection is obvious, such as gender - label with for
				will suffice
			</p>
			<form>
				<fieldset>
					<legend>Choose one of these three items:</legend>
					<input id="one" type="radio" name="items" value="one" />
					<label for="one">Choice One</label><br />
					<input id="two" type="radio" name="items" value="two" />
					<label for="two">Choice Two</label><br />
					<input id="three" type="radio" name="items" value="three" />
					<label for="three">Choice Three</label>
				</fieldset>
			</form>
			<h2>accessible date picker</h2>
			<p>input type, introduced in HTML5</p>
			<p>
				for older browsers, the type will default to text, so show users the
				expected date format in the label or placeholder text
			</p>
			<label for="pickdate">preferred date:</label>
			<input type="date" id="pickdate" name="date" />
			<h2>time and datetime</h2>
			<p>wrap dates or times with the time element and datetime attribute</p>
			<p>
				datetime value is accessed by assistve devices and avoids confusion for
				informally stated dates
			</p>
			<p>
				"the knight defeated the hollow knight
				<time datetime="2022-05-10">last Monday</time>"
			</p>
			<h2>CSS</h2>
			<p>
				use CSS to visually hide content meant only for screen readers, such as
				when a screen reader needs a chart in table form, by pushing it out of
				the viewport
			</p>
			<p>
				.sr-only { position: absolute; left: -10000px; width: 1px; height: 1px;
				top: auto; overflow: hidden; }
			</p>
			<p>
				note that display: none and visibility: hidden hide the content for
				everyone, and 0px values remove item from flow of page making it
				unreadable by screen readers
			</p>
			<h2>color</h2>
			<p>
				use high contrast text - at least a 4.5 to 1 contrast ratio for normal
				text
			</p>
			<p>check using online tools such as the mui color tool</p>
			<p>
				as we know, don't just use color to convey important info - screen
				readers can't read this - use text alternatives
			</p>
			<p>
				consider color blindness by shading darker colors (with blues, violets,
				magentas, reds) and tinting lighter colors (with oranges, yellows,
				greens and blue-greens) - try hsl() for example
			</p>
			<h2>heading</h2>
			<p>content</p>
			<p>content</p>
